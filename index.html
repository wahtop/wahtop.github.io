        <p> Come and visit Narnia! It has the sea to its east, a southern peaceful land, and unknown lands to the west and north if you feel like exploring. You can go via Wardrobe, near-death drowning, train, magical ring, etc. You can visit places like the lamppost. the throneroom, and finally express your feelings towards wasps, dogs, bees, rats, hamsters, fish, cats and others. You can even sail the seas like a pirate, just try not get sold into slavery or eat at an abondened banquet. The catch is that you can only go when its least expected, or else you will</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Look stupid by claiming a plastic ring can do "magical" things</li> 
      <li>waste your money if you tried to buy a "magical" wardrobe.</li>
      <li>Run inside the closet to try to get to Narnia to play with snow and hit your head at the back.</li>  
      <li>Actually DIE from drowning.</li> 
      <li>ALMOST die from a moving train.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p> <strong>Always</strong> be careful</p>
    <h3>-- Narnian Government Simplified--</h3>

        <p>Narnia is Formally known as a Tertrarchy as its ruled by four kids, but overseen by Aslan, a lion.  This lion is the wisest of all because it is now the only creature with powers. There used to be a second creature with powers, but Aslan decided it was time for lunch. The kids names were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Peter - High King</li>
            <li>Susan - Queen</li>
            <li>Edmund - King</li>
            <li>Lucy - Queen</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Life was good until they grew up. When it was time to go, the four hugged Aslan and abdicated the throne. Peter and Susan were adults and knew that they would never come back. Before she left, she thought it would be a great Susan stole a kiss from Caspian and left.</p>
     <h3>-- To all who want to visit Narnia on-command --</h3>

     <p>Since Aslan ate creature #2, I assume Aslan gained more powers. You should follow my master plan to get to Narnia on command
     <ol class="Wahcipie">
         <li>write a note to tell yourself to meet Aslan. Put that note in your hat and that hat in your backpack.</li>
         <li>Forget about Narnia and either go through some generic near-death experience, follow the book and decide to open the window so that water can destroy your room and almost kill you, or play hide-and-seek. </li>
         <li>When you get in, it should be chilly so pull out your hat and accidently see the note. When you see the note you should bust your behind to find Aslan before he disappears.(If you were smart, you would provoke Aslan until he tries to kill you. Before he does, simply apologize).</li>
         <li>Offer a deal of a lifetime. I don't care how, but just do it. If you manage to complete these four steps...then congratulations! You can use Narnia as a place to sleep, do homework, and make "instant" food without wasting time.</li>
     </ol>
    <h4>Thank you for learning more about Narnia and I hope to see you there!</h4>
